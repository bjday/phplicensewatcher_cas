+Welcome.

+All credit is due to the creators of PHPlicensewatcher found at http://phplicensewatch.sourceforge.net/

+

+This repository is the code probject that added CAS authentication to the PHPlicensewatcher and modified the code as needed to make it work on my system.  

+

+I will attempt to bracket all of my changes within lines:

+<!-- bjday added

+<!-- end bjday

+or

+#bjday added

+#bjday end

+

+there is a switch variable in the config_cas.php file that turn on or off CAS authentication

+

+

+HOW TO USE THIS

+first place welcome.php at the head of your html directory.

+

+mkdir phplicensewatcher  in that same level

+

+copy all files to phplicensewatcher except welcome.php

+

+edit welcome.php to use your servername and point the redirect to location of admin.php also ether add link to config_cas.php to the same directory as welcome.php or modiefy welcome.php to point to config_cas.php

+

+edit config_cas.php to work with your cas system or change disable_cas variable to 1

+

+point your web browser to the check_installation.php  it is not CAS authenticated.  Make sure all work except for i4blt it is not used or atleast I do not know what it is used for.  

+

+Follow the phpLicensewatcher install directions if there are problems.
